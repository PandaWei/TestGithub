# Firstly, I want to say thank you.
# we all know that,

# Not everybody can get the interview chance face by face.
# I'm glad to talk about myself here. 


My personal inforation has been written on the paper. and you can got more details at my resume.

I graduated from JN university, which located in WuXi, and got my master degree.
My major is computer application technology.

# There's a lot of things and memory in my student life, which makes me feel be proud of it.
# Just for your information,

Now, i am a software development engineer at Y, 
which was established by NJ university and F group.
which is also one of the most famous IT company at Japan and It have good cooperation with Redhat.

I am good at c and python programming language.
Linux platform is familar to me,
I am able to make full use of open source tools to program and debug, such as, gcc, gdb. 

And then,
I have got the certificate of software designer and network engineer.
The certificates are good enough evidence for my ability at programming.

Generally speaking,
Project experience is important to a softeware engineer, specially, who want to get a new job.

so, I have to talk about my experience in the last 4 years;

As same as you see on my resume,
I had attended several projects, we can divide them into two group,
One is related to Open Source, everyone can contribute to and obtain them without any charge.
The other is not.

I'm very interested in Open Source and its' community, 
such as openstack, linux test project, libvirt and so on.

Especially,
I would like to focus on Autotest, which is a open framework to automate test.
it's designed to test linux kernel.
But now, Anybody can add test object into it, for example, 
qemu, libvirt and other virtualization technology.

I am the maintainer of it's virtualization module, 
and contributed more than 200 patches to it.

Besides above, I want to introduce the experience of HPC project,
HPC means high performance compute.

Maybe you heard ShuGuang super computer, which created by chinese.
I am doing some work for another super computer,
we call it K-computer at fujitsu group.
I am responsible for staging function, which used to transfer huge data
between different nodes with high speed.
It involves many technology point. I have listed them in the resume.


Maybe you will ask me why i want to change a job.
To be honest, The biggest reason is salary.

Not long ago, I bought a house at JN district. It brings me a lot of pressure.
I had to consider how can i pay off a large sum of money to bank.
And i want to learn more new knowledge about programming,
and to do some challening work.
X is a gloabl company. i feel it meets all of my requirements and maybe give me some special experience.

At last, 
I think i am a hard-working, responsible and outgoing person.
I am also a good team player and will be happy to work together with other workmates.

Ok, I wish my words can persuade you to trust me.
trust that i can do some valuable work and contribution for X.
